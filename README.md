Important:

This project was done as an fun assignment under an IIT-Bombay eyantra course.
Hence it is not for production purpose.

The code is the bare minimum for the ChatBot to work.

Code works on the localhost server using the specified port. 

To run:
First execute the w6_activity2_server.py

then the w6_activity2_client.py


If the website is not hosted then host the index.html file on localhost and change the code accordingly.
